,"All births which occur in Scotland should be registered in Scotland, even if the people involved are residents of other countries.  "
,These figures do not include any names that were given to babies who were stillborn.
,Baby names statistics do not include names given to babies of Scottish residents where the birth occurred outwith Scotland.
,The statistics are based on the exact spelling of the name given on the birth certificate.
,"Different spellings (for example Stephen, Steven; Holly, Hollie; Callum, Calum) were counted separately. "
,"Variants based on the same name were counted separately (for example ‘Ben’ and ‘Benjamin’ are different names, likewise ‘Agnes’ and ‘Senga’, and ‘Tony’ and ‘Anthony’)."
,"Accents were ignored, so (for example) ‘Chloe’, ‘Chloé’, ‘Chloë’. ‘Chloè’ and ‘Chlöe’ are all counted as the same name: ‘Chloe’."

,Names with a count of 2 or less in total within Scotland have been suppressed (an exemption applies under Section 38 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002) in order to protect the confidentiality of individuals.
